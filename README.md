## üì¶ Description

The nestjs-drizzle-template helps you kickstart your project with Drizzle in a NestJs environment. This template includes essential features like a configuration module, rate limiting with a throttler, and a custom Drizzle module for database interactions. Whether you are building an API or a full-featured application, this template provides a solid foundation.

## üìù Features

- **Easy Setup:** Start your project without the hassle of manual configuration.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect your API from excessive requests using the throttler.
- **Database Integration:** Quickly connect your application to a PostgreSQL database.
- **OpenAPI Documentation:** Automatically generate API documentation for developers.
- **Swagger UI:** Easily view and test your API endpoints visually.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** - Version 14 or higher
- **NPM** - Included with Node.js
- **PostgreSQL** - Installed and running on your machine

If you have a different PostgreSQL setup (like Docker), ensure it's accessible to your application.
